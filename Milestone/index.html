<h3>About Our Senior Capstone Milestone #1</h3>
<p> For this Capstone my team and I have chosen the topic of Malware Analysis Using Reverse Engineering. The group sponsor for this project is Dr. Hossain Shahriar. For this project we are researching the binary analysis tools IDAPro and WinDbg. In our Milestone #1 we will research how these tools function by seeing how they detect malware, what type of malware can each tool detect, and what are some strengths and weaknesses our each tool. During this Milestone we have also started research into how malware is able to elude detection from these tools. We also have started to gather a better understanding of how effective these tools are in today's enviornment. This will be substantial in our later tasks of setting up security policies to help better detect, and protect from malware.
